# LLM-Powered-Operational-Decision-Support-Tool
Decision-support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform large-scale, messy operational data into actionable insights and executable decisions.  The system is designed for operations-heavy environments (e.g. manufacturing, logistics, energy systems), where decisions must be made under complex constraints and data uncertainty.
